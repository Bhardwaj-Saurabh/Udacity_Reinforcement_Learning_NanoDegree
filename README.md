## Table of Contents

### Labs / Projects

The labs and projects can be found below.  All of the projects use rich simulation environments from [Unity ML-Agents](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/ml-agents). In the [Deep Reinforcement Learning Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/deep-reinforcement-learning-nanodegree--nd893) program, you will receive a review of your project.  These reviews are meant to give you personalized feedback and to tell you what can be improved in your code.

* [The Taxi Problem](https://github.com/udacity/deep-reinforcement-learning/tree/master/lab-taxi): In this lab, you will train a taxi to pick up and drop off passengers.
* [Navigation](https://github.com/udacity/deep-reinforcement-learning/tree/master/p1_navigation): In the first project, you will train an agent to collect yellow bananas while avoiding blue bananas.
* [Continuous Control](https://github.com/udacity/deep-reinforcement-learning/tree/master/p2_continuous-control): In the second project, you will train an robotic arm to reach target locations.
* [Collaboration and Competition](https://github.com/udacity/deep-reinforcement-learning/tree/master/p3_collab-compet): In the third project, you will train a pair of agents to play tennis!
