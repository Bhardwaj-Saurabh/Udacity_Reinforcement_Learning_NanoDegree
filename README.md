This repository contains material related to Udacity's [Deep Reinforcement Learning Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/deep-reinforcement-learning-nanodegree--nd893) program.  

### Labs / Projects

The labs and projects can be found below.  All of the projects use rich simulation environments from [Unity ML-Agents](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/ml-agents). In the [Deep Reinforcement Learning Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/deep-reinforcement-learning-nanodegree--nd893) program, you will receive a review of your project.  These reviews are meant to give you personalized feedback and to tell you what can be improved in your code.

* [Navigation](https://github.com/Bhardwaj-Saurabh/Udacity_Reinforcement_Learning_NanoDegree/tree/main/Project_1-Navigation): In the first project, you will train an agent to collect yellow bananas while avoiding blue bananas.
* [Continuous Control](https://github.com/Bhardwaj-Saurabh/Udacity_Reinforcement_Learning_NanoDegree/tree/main/Project_2-Continous%20Control): In the second project, you will train an robotic arm to reach target locations.
* [Collaboration and Competition](https://github.com/Bhardwaj-Saurabh/Udacity_Reinforcement_Learning_NanoDegree/tree/main/Project_3-Collaboration%20and%20Competition): In the third project, you will train a pair of agents to play tennis!
